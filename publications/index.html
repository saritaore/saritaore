To understand the role of GBV on girls’ education, we randomized not only exposure to the intervention but also whether the student component was targeted to girls only, boys only, or both. Our findings indicate a reduction in sexual violence by teachers and school staff against girls, regardless of the targeted gender group, providing evidence of the role of improving the capacity of key school personnel to deter perpetrators. Using administrative records, we also find that in schools where the intervention encouraged proactive behavior by girls, there was an increase in their school enrollment, largely due to an increased propensity for GBV reporting by victims.

Municipalities assigned to IOBI contracts exhibited significantly stronger managerial engagement, better coordination with health services, and more frequent adoption of complementary strategies to address anemia. These behavioral changes translated into modest but statistically significant improvements in timely vaccination coverage and anemia testing rates.
