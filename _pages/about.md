Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics and Education at Columbia University. I expect to graduate in Spring 2027. 

My research focuses on topics in development, education, health, and gender economics. I use both lab experiments and tools from applied microeconomics. My current projects are based in Peru and Mozambique.

I received my master’s degree in Economics from Los Andes University in Bogotá, Colombia, and a  bachelor’s degree in Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, Peru.
