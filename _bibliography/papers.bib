  abstract={This paper examines a school infrastructure upgrading program and its direct and indirect impacts on enrollment, school dropout rates, and student achievement. We exploit the program’s rollout over four years before an abrupt redesign left some schools without the upgrade. Our findings suggest that schools receiving the upgrades experienced a 0.58 percentage point reduction in dropout rates. However, we observe spillover effects on nearby schools: an increase in private school closures and a decline in enrollment, predominantly affecting the public sector. Notably, reading test scores in nearby private and public schools also dropped, suggesting that the students leaving these schools were likely those with higher human capital.},

  title={Gender-Based Violence in Schools and Girls’ Education: Experimental Evidence from Mozambique},
  author={Amaral, Sofia and Garcia, Aixa and Gulesci, Selim and Ramos, Alejandra and Sviatschi, Micaela},
  abstract = {Gender-based violence (GBV) at schools is a pervasive problem that affects millions of adolescent girls worldwide. In partnership with the Ministry of Education in Mozambique, we developed an intervention to increase the capacity of key school personnel to address GBV and to improve students’ awareness as well as proactive behaviors. To understand the role of GBV on girls’ education, we randomized not only exposure to the intervention but also whether the student component was targeted to girls only, boys only, or both. Our findings indicate a reduction in sexual violence by teachers and school staff against girls, regardless of the targeted gender group, providing evidence of the role of improving the capacity of key school personnel to deter perpetrators. Using administrative records, we also find that in schools where the intervention encouraged proactive behavior by girls, there was an increase in their school enrollment, largely due to an increased propensity for GBV reporting by victims. Our findings suggest that effectively mitigating violence to improve girls’ schooling requires a dual approach: deterring potential perpetrators and fostering a proactive stance among victims, such as increased reporting.},
